## 🌟 Key Features

- **100% Local & Private**: All processing happens directly in your browser. Your images never leave your computer.
- **High-Quality Inpainting**: Uses the powerful LaMa (Large Mask Inpainting) AI model to intelligently remove the watermark with minimal impact on the original image.
- **Preserves Original Quality**: Only the small watermark area is modified. The rest of your image remains pixel-perfect and untouched.
- **Modern & Intuitive UI**: A sleek, responsive interface with drag-and-drop support, a real-time progress bar, and detailed logs.
- **Before & After Comparison**: An interactive slider lets you instantly compare the original and cleaned images to see the results.
- **Efficient Performance**: The AI model is loaded once and cached for subsequent uses. A modular architecture ensures a smooth user experience.
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and open for community contributions.
